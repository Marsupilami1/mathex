#+TITLE: Mathex

~mathex~ converts a natural maths formula into TeX.

* Why?
LaTeX mathematical formulas are pretty, but long to type.
In fact, it's too long for note taking, so I wanted a simple and fast way to write LaTeX formulas.
This is also a personal training to lexing and parsing in Haskell.
I personaly add a shortcut in my editor to quickly convert "natural formulas".
* Examples
For a complete overview of the possibilities, please look at the file ~test/test.txt~.
** Simple formula
~1 + 2x / 3 - y~

~1+\dfrac{2x}{3}-y~
** Limit
~limit as x -> 0 of sin(x)/x is 1~

~\dfrac{\sin\left(x\right)}{x}\xrightarrow[x\rightarrow 0]{} 1~
** Integral
~integral from a to b of f(x) dx~

~\int_{a}^{b}f\left(x\right)dx~
** Functions
~cos(a + b) = cos(a)cos(b) - sin(a)sin(b)~

~\cos\left(a+b\right)=\cos\left(a\right)\cos\left(b\right)-\sin\left(a\right)\sin\left(b\right)~
